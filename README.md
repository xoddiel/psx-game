# `psx-game`
This is a PSX game project developed entirely in rust as part of an educational series by Xoddiel d'Croy, which can be
found [here](https://xoddiel.net/psx-game.html).

# Acknowledgments
This project wouldn't be possible without prior work done by the maintainers of the [`psx`](https://github.com/ayrtonm/
psx-sdk-rs) crate, and without the unofficial [PSX documentation](https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/) created by 
[nocash](https://problemkaputt.de/psx-spx.htm).
